# PowerBI-Sample-

This repository contains a collection of Power BI projects created for demonstration and personal learning purposes. 
Some projects are inspired by real-world business scenarios, particularly in the financial domain, while others explore personal interests. 
Public datasets, including those from platforms like Kaggle, are used to simulate realistic use cases.
The aim is to showcase data visualization, modeling, and storytelling skills across different contexts.
